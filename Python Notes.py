The programming Fundamentals

Sequence - The order in which programs run (line by line)
Selection - If/Elif/Else Statements
Iteration - For/While Loops


BASIC DATATYPES

INTEGER - Whole Number
Float - Decimal Number
Bool - Boolean - True or False
String - Quotation Marks

these datatypes can be stored in variables but they are NOT variable names

DATATYPES IN PYTHON
str is short for string
int is short for integer
bool is short for boolean/ true/false
float means decimal numbers

SO I'll show you an example of how to define a type

VARIABLENAME = DATATYPE(input(STRING)) -- this example tells you what to do


Arithmetic Notes

+ means add
- means subtract
* means times
/ means divide
% means modular (don't worry about this piece of shit yet)

always include f-string while printing (remember the curly brackets) { }
example:

If/elif/else notes

IMPORTANT SYMBOLS
Symbol | English
!= - not equal to
== - is equal to
<= - greater then or equal to
>= - less than or equal to
> - less than
< - greater then

IMPORTANT KEY WORDS
and
or
not

EXAMPLES OF ABOVE

if 1 == 3:
    print("Hello World")
else:
    print("1 is not equal to 3")

English: if 1 is equal to 1 and 2 is equal to 2 then print Hello World



Libraries

A library is programming made by someone else either built into a programming language
OR made by other developers

Libraries can be:
Time
Random

Or more complex like tkinter which is a GUI creator essentially.


Beginnings of String Manipulation

print("kyle".title())
print("KYLE".lower())
print("kyle".upper())

name = input("Name: ").lower()

if name == "kyle":
    print("this works")
else:
    print("this is wrong.")
