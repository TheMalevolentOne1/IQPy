BASIC DATATYPES

INTEGER - Whole Number
Float - Decimal Number
Bool - Boolean - True or False
String - Quotation Marks

these datatypes can be stored in variables but they are NOT variable names

DATATYPES IN PYTHON
str is short for string
int is short for integer
bool is short for boolean/ true/false
float means decimal numbers

SO I'll show you an example of how to define a type

VARIABLENAME = DATATYPE(input(STRING)) -- this example tells you what to do


Arithmetic Notes

+ means add
- means subtract
* means times
/ means divide
% means modular (don't worry about this piece of shit yet)

always include f-string while printing (remember the curly brackets) { }
example:

'''
'''

If/elif/else notes

if EXPRESSION:

elif EXPRESSION:

else:
'''

# if expression:
# in english this means if expression then
# if 1 == 1:
# this means IF 1 is equal to 1 THEN somthing happens? (yes) yeah
