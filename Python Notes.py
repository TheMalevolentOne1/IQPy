Libraries

A library is programming made by someone else either built into a programming language
OR made by other developers

Libraries can be:
Time
Random

Or more complex like tkinter which is a GUI creator essentially.

EXAMPLE OF RANDOM

import random

shopping_list = ["orange", "apple", "pear"]

# from here you can use this list of items to get a random choice

print(random.choice(shopping_list))
