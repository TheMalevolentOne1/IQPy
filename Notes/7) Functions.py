Function Notes

A function is a small piece of code that can be run over and over again

'''

# Example Function

def exampleFunction(par1):
    print(par1)

exampleFunction("Example Parameter Input")

# edit this code until you have a somewhat ideal understanding ALSO
# functions exist to be called MULTIPLE TIMES

# see mhm i do now
# uhh yea ig = no. Please edit the function

# try to make a function that will add two strings together and then return the two
# strings added together
# uhh i have no clue how i'd do that
# use the example above I provided
# its basically string + string thats it you have an example with the add() function
# copy the add function and then edit accordingly
